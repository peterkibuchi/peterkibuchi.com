title: Why I Quit School
date: "2022-06-27"
---

I can't quite remember how it came to me, the idea of leaving school. All I remember is I first conceived it a year and a half or so back. The idea took on a life of its own after that, and before I knew it, it had grown into a deep conviction that it was the right thing to do. May 2021 would have marked the start of my third year in college, in pursuit of a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, but, as you can probably tell by now, it didn't: I left school to pursue the path of an autodidact.

I was adamant it was the right thing to do, and yet it was no easy decision. Almost everyone I sought counsel from (and even those who were kind enough to offer it unsolicited) firmly opposed the idea. _I may have had valid reasons to quit yes, but why not just finish?_ There were only two years left after all, they argued, and chances are the reader of this essay feels the same way. I had an answer to that as well, one that I felt very strongly about and believed to be important with regard to the way we (should) live our lives, and one which I'll provide later on.

_But why quit school in the first place?_ Well, my goal was to learn, and it had become clear to me that what took place at school was anything but. I could do better. I knew for a fact that I could learn _the right things_ _the right way_ (all in a less expensive manner) if I chose to go it alone; and once that was established, all that was left was the simple, not so simple matter of making a decision. _How did I know I could do better?_ Well, I'll be answering that question over the course of this essay, but first, allow me to let you in on some dirty little secrets.

## School's Dirty Little Secrets

_Education is the key —_ or so we've been told. At the core, there is a very pervasive myth in society, one which I'll debunk here. The myth that _to learn anything, one has to do it in the formal setting of a classroom._ That _to gain expertise, one has to enroll in a formal course or degree, and have someone lecture it to them._ It may not be explicitly stated most times, but it is firmly ingrained in our culture and way of thinking. Such can be evidenced by the opposition one would face if they chose to go it alone, as I did; more on that later.

My intention is to stand this conventional wisdom on its head. In fact, I will endeavour to show that it is quite the contrary. That to learn anything of consequence, one must do so _outside_ a classroom. That true learning does not look like learning, and conversely, one should be very suspicious of learning that does. And what better place to start than by laying bare school's dirty little secrets for all to see?

### Very Little Transfers From The Classroom To The Real World

School's approach is to teach abstract, universal, theoretical concepts, in the belief that students will in turn (be able to) apply them concretely in the real world. For example, they will teach you Calculus — how to solve equations and stuff — but never where such knowledge will apply outside the classroom, let alone how to apply it; you are expected to figure that out yourself. In theory, this approach should work, except for one thing: it doesn't.[^1]

For Pete's sake, this is the worst possible way to go about it. The human mind struggles with the abstract, the universal. Take, for instance, that one could teach you the so-called principles of good web design, but you would never be able to translate them into a visually appealing website. We are simply unable to apply abstract concepts learnt in the context of a classroom to the real world. This approach simply doesn't work.

The same mind that struggles with abstract classroom concepts, however, is the same mind that thrives when immersed into the concrete, the particular, real world. It would not be until someone gave you concrete guidelines on what to do that your design would improve, e.g., use a larger line height for readability and be consistent with your spacing.

Very little transfers from the classroom to the real world. Most people will agree that what they learnt in school is mostly useless, inapplicable to the real world. That one learns their craft by actually diving into it, by _doing_, or what is usually referred to as _learning on the job._ Colleges require students to get an internship before they can graduate, so they can gain so-called "work experience" to supplement what they've "learnt" in school. They've got it backwards — abstract knowledge should be that which supplements real world experience.

### On Skin In The Game (Or The Lack Thereof), And Talkers vs Doers

Have you ever wondered to yourself the reason why plane crashes are rare? The answer is quite simple. Pilots — in addition to actually being trained in the real world — have their skin in the game. They know that if the plane were to go down, they would go down with it. A reckless pilot would cost us some lives, but he would also exit the gene pool, never to harm us again. The system is thus rid of bad elements — it learns from it's mistakes, and improves.

Absence of skin in the game is a huge flaw in the education system. It explains why the system is riddled with agency problems.[^2] Since there is no disincentive for when things go wrong, i.e., the pilot doesn't go down with the plane, serious conflicts of interest arise. Take for instance how vice-chancellors operate with impunity. They mismanage universities and cripple them with debt, comfortable in the knowledge that they will be long gone when the chickens come home to roost. And you know what the best part is (if you are a former vice-chancellor)? You get to keep all the fat cheques you pocketed while you were running the university into the ground. The people in charge don't truly care whether the system works or not. Lecturers don't truly care whether you understand what they teach or not. They’ve got nothing to lose; the payslip comes in at the end of the month regardless.

It gets worse. Courses are taught by talkers rather than doers, theorists rather than practitioners. On the surface, this might seem harmless, but there are significant implications. I invite the reader to remember the stark difference between the abstract and the concrete; what happens in the classroom stays in the classroom, and we learn our crafts by actually diving into them, by _doing_.[^3] A child can effortlessly ride a bike, having never heard of Newton's laws of motion. Do you imagine the child would do as well if — instead of just giving them a bike — we taught them all the Math and Physics "they would need to know?" Experience with the bike (practice) does more for them than what a lifetime's worth of trying to understand the "relevant" abstract concepts (theory) would.[^4] The same goes for learning how to play the guitar, perform a handstand, build a successful business, and virtually everything else based in reality.

One can now start to see the danger of having talkers being the ones designing the curriculum and doing the teaching. Most have no idea what truly goes on in the real world, they can only theorize. And owing to their lack of skin in the game, they never learn. They — in spite of (or perhaps as a result of) (over)complicating the simple — completely miss that which is important (signal), that which counts, and lay emphasis on that which is mostly useless (noise). "Five-year-old kids with bikes" easily _outdo_ them.

And so the system self-perpetuates. Talkers and theorists with no skin in the game are in charge of the system and the curriculum, as well as teaching it. How do we know they're competent? All the degrees, of course. The precious degrees they acquired from other talkers and theorists, no less. Any who would seek to effect change is faced with a catch-22 — they would have to do it from the inside, but to get inside they would have to comply with the very system they wish to change.

Absence of skin in the game, however, doesn't amount to an absence of consequences. The bill comes due alright. These talkers/bureaucrats have other people's skin in the game, and it is them who suffer the consequences of their actions: the parents (and students), who spend a fortune on higher education, often taking on crippling financial debt just to meet the cost; the students, who put so much time and effort into school and yet have nothing to show for it; society at large, that is no better for all the talking and theorizing. The bad elements persist, and we are stuck with a broken system — one that doesn't learn from its mistakes, one that doesn't improve.

### The Bed of Procrustes

> Procrustes was an inn-keeper in Greek mythology who, in order to make the travelers fit in his bed, cut the limbs of those who were too tall and stretched those who were too short. But he had the bed fitting the visitor with total perfection.

I was on a road trip a while back when an interesting topic arose. It was about a girl who completed her high school education last year. She wanted to pursue a bachelor's degree in Law, but couldn't, because she did not get a "good grade." Her parent couldn't afford self-sponsorship, so she was being advised to look for another course instead, one that she would be granted government sponsorship to pursue. Various options we being offered, for example, catering, and they were all being framed as "good courses" she could pursue.

Despite being quite annoyed about the situation from the outset, I had resolved to stay out of the conversation (there was no point getting angry about things I could do nothing about); but at this point I found I could no longer contain myself. I voiced a question, "Why is the girl being fit to the course instead of the course being fit to the girl?"

This is a good example of a Procrustean bed — modern society is fraught with them. Trying to tailor humans to fit an unnatural system, instead of tailoring the system to fit humans. The girl should have the freedom to pursue the profession of her choice. And the fact that we are limiting her to a handful of courses, none of which she fancied in the first place, means something somewhere is terribly wrong.

"But what of her grade?" you might ask. "She didn't qualify," you might say. Think about it. The grade, given just how much it is determined by luck, tells us little of her intelligence, let alone of her suitability to the course. Consider that the KCSE, being just _one_ exam, provides a very small sample of information on the four years one spent in school. Add to that the variation introduced by students taking on a number of different subjects, each with its own degree of difficulty that year; papers being marked by different teachers; along with other (known and unknown) factors, and one starts to see how judging students on the basis of their grade is folly. And just between you and me, I have doubts knowing _tofauti katika fasihi simulizi na fasihi andishi_ makes for a better lawyer in the first place.

Let us go a step further. The only reason the government cannot afford to sponsor more students (and thus has to determine who qualifies based on their grade) is because higher education is so damn expensive, and growing more so as time goes by. Which begs the question: why? If it were cheaper, it would be accessible to more people, both because more students could afford it and the government would be able to sponsor more of them. I can't seem to think of a better reason other than universities are money minting machines, doing so at the expense of students who have no (apparent) choice but to pay for the degree.[^5] How unfortunate. It doesn't end there however, there are further implications.

What profession should one pursue? This is a very difficult question — the answer to which, mind you, might as well determine the trajectory of the rest of one's life. How are young men and women barely eighteen years old expected to know the answer? The truth is, they can't. At least not at that point in time.[^6] They can only follow their curiosity, try different things, see what suits them. Sadly, the expensive nature of higher education makes this nigh on impossible. It makes it such that this is a decision they absolutely have to get right, first-time. And when they don't, which is oft the case, they are forced to go on pursuing something they would now rather not; or worse, as we have seen, one they never wanted at all.[^7]

I believe school in and of itself to be one of the largest Procrustean beds we have come up with yet. Learning is messy — what is it, truly, and how does it take place? Damned if anyone knows. The uncertainty wouldn't do though, so we set about standardizing it into a neat process. We reduced intelligence to that which can be tested within a classroom — causing whole generations of students to believe themselves to be stupid just because they couldn't pass tests with no bearing on the real world, and vice versa. Complex real world expertise was packaged into textbooks and courses — commodities we can now put a price on. And determining one's proficiency and competence is easy now, it's simply a function of one's academic credentials. Hooray, no more uncertainty. And who cares if we had to decapitate the guest, he now fits the bed to perfection.

### A Mummer's Farce

School _as a learning institution_ is what someone from George R.R. Martin's _World of Ice and Fire_ would refer to as a mummer's farce. It's a sham. An outright lie we sell ourselves. A cruel joke we both tell and are the butt of. We all know this at a certain level, but play along nevertheless to fit in. Allow me to explain by making known to you some open secrets, some of which you are likely already aware of.

When I completed my primary school education, I was excited about the prospect of joining one certain prestigious high school of my dreams.[^8] I had passed very well, and given the fact that I had attended a public school, a vacancy at the high school was all but assured. My hopes were dashed, my heart broken, however, when I was placed in another (lower-ranking) school instead. Someone later explained to me that what would have been my spot must have been given to someone who made a certain "financial contribution." There was no way to know for certain, nor anything I could do about it, so I sucked it up and went where I was placed. There I learnt to my horror that this kind of thing actually happens, and to very many kids every year, no less. The administrations at these schools have no scruples about asking for and accepting bribes to take opportunities from those who deserve them and gift them to those who don't.

It doesn't end there. Not only did I discover that cheating in national examinations was in fact real — many candidates brought phones to school in anticipation of leakage they had paid for in advance[^9] — I was surprised to learn that teachers aided candidates in doing so as well. And as it turned out, this was the norm across the country, not the exception.[^10] When the results came out and we had "done well," there was jubilant celebration across the school; so happy we were. We would have special supper to celebrate and soon after, thanksgiving mass to "thank God for the good results."

Cheating wasn't only reserved for the national examinations however; many students cheated in internal exams as well. This was highly frowned upon by the administration though: those who were unfortunate enough to get caught were shamed in front of everyone else in assemblies, then suspended. Captains were (in addition) demoted and criticized for setting a bad example. The teachers would then go on about the importance of integrity for what seemed like forever. How lucky we were to have such paragons of model behaviour to look up to.

Fast forward to university, and little, if anything, has changed for the better. Lecturers fail to attend a whole semester's worth of classes then rush to cram everything within two or three make-up lectures two weeks to the exams. Students feel compelled to cheat because nobody wants to fail and be left behind. For the right price, and if you know the right people, you can have access to the exam papers long before you set foot in the exam hall. Many pay others to do their final projects for them; not only at undergraduate level, but at masters level as well. And just like how wide-eyed high school kids celebrate results they know at a certain level to be fake, so do university students celebrate their graduation. For many though, the joy soon turns to ashes in their mouth when they realize just how little their degree is worth and how hard it is to find employment in today's job market. Few are lucky enough to find a job.[^11]

Does the reader see it now? This is what happens when you rely on standards dreamt up by some bureaucrats with no skin in the game — people (will always) find a way to game the system. They do this not because they are inherently evil, but simply because they want to get ahead in life.[^12] Some of us have a stronger sense of ethics than others, true, but that's the way it has always been. Given the knowledge that people will always be people, the aim should be to build a system that is robust to human nature, one that cannot be gamed; not to rely on a fragile vulnerable one, and then hope that people will magically turn into angels.[^13] There is no better way to do this than to let reality be the judge — as we will see later on, she cannot be fooled.

In this section I made an effort to expose some of the most glaring flaws in the current education system as well as debunk the myth that _to learn anything, one has to do it in the context of a classroom_. In fact, I have gone to great lengths to show that it is quite the contrary. But if one looking to learn could do much better than a classroom, how would one go about learning _outside_ it? We will now attempt to answer that question by diving into something many haven't realized yet: the environment has changed.

## The Environment Has Changed

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, and everything went into lockdown, I suddenly found that I had more time on my hands than I knew what to do with. With schools closed, I found it particularly difficult to focus on schoolwork even without its inherent dullness coming into play. I spent the early part of that period adapting to the new life, following my curiosity and contemplating existential questions.[^14]

One day, as fate would have it, I chanced upon Codecademy (an online platform for learning how to code) in what would prove to be one of the most serendipitous occurrences in my life. I went on to learn more on my own in three months than I had in two years at school. I did not have someone read to me verbatim from a dreary PowerPoint presentation while I was absent-minded, wishing I were somewhere else — attending classes not because I would understand the content any better, but because I needed to take notes so I could have source material to cram later on, and because it soothed my conscience to know I hadn't missed anything. Neither did I endure a dreaded exam that supposedly tested whether I had truly absorbed the concepts taught; concepts I would go on to forget the moment I handed in my answer booklet.

Rather, I learnt by taking on actual real world projects. And oh, did I enjoy it. I went at my own pace, followed my curiosity, learnt that which I wanted to learn. Suddenly, failure wasn't treated like the end of the world, something to be avoided at all costs, but rather a valuable source of information, something to learn from. What's more, I had access to a very supportive community of peers from all over the world, learners just like me. When it was announced that we would be resuming school, to complete the semester that had been cut off, I found myself particularly unenthusiastic about the prospect; I knew it would mean less time for my learning endeavours. I didn't realize it then, but the seeds for my eventual decision to quit school had been planted.

See how the internet empowers one to learn, something many people don't seem to have realized yet. There used to be a time when learning institutions were the gatekeepers of knowledge. No longer; the internet has democratized it. Pick a subject. Anything you'd like to learn. Like as not you will find a vast library of resources on the web. A whole community of peers and experts too. Learning platforms like Codecademy or Coursera provide a wide range of disciplines one could pursue, and for a fraction of the cost of university degrees. And those are only the paid platforms — a lion’s share of resources are available for free. To quote Naval Ravikant, "Free education is abundant, all over the Internet. It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce."

## A Better Approach

If there’s one thing I’ve learnt about life, it’s that there are no absolutes. Nothing is objectively good or bad, right or wrong, wise or foolish. Plenty of virtue can arise from undesirable events, and plenty of bad can arise from that which we perceive to be good. This is one of the reasons why I am skeptical of advice (especially unsolicited advice). What has worked in the past may not work now. What works for you may not work for me. What we think works may not work at all. And what we are "certain" doesn’t work may hold the key to the outcomes we desire. For instance, we are often told procrastination is bad for us, but this hasn’t always been my experience. I have often made serendipitous discoveries that would go on to have a outsized positive impact on my life, discoveries I wouldn’t have made had I been doing "what I was supposed to be doing."

Now, school may be inherently flawed, but that is not to say it has no redeeming qualities. Alas, I would be remiss if I didn’t present that other side of the story. There’s the interesting classes you actually want to attend. There’s the lively professors that make learning fun and take their jobs seriously, not to mention the ones that actually ride bikes. There's the friends we make along the way, the social networks we forge. And so on. But I don’t see why we can’t have all this good stuff _and_ a learning environment that actually works.

I would like to suggest a better approach, or, more accurately, a less wrong approach. Consider the following asymmetry. It is far more difficult to prove a theory than it is to disprove one — even if we observed a million white swans, we still couldn’t claim that _all swans are white_; all it would take would be a single observation of a black swan to prove us wrong. Thus we know with a lot more certainty what doesn’t work than what does. Therefore it is far more robust to remove that which doesn’t work, _via negativa_, than it is to add that which we think works. Complex systems don’t get better by theorizing about what the best course of action is. They evolve by trial and error: they make lots of tiny variations, lock down the benefits, and get rid of that which doesn’t work. Here lies yet another asymmetry: with such an approach, you stand to gain more than you will lose — the downside is limited, the upside is not. Nature doesn’t have a mind of her own, and yet through millions of years of stochastic tinkering she was able to develop complex organisms like us. In this same light, let us see how we would go about improving the system, _via negativa_.

_Primo._ Let reality be the judge. Unlike a system that relies on standards dreamt up by bureaucrats, she is much harder to fool. Reality doesn’t care about your credentials; you are either fit for your occupation or you are not, simple as that. This is good news, because it means that anyone can learn anything, and they don’t have to enroll in a formal course or degree to do it.[^15][^16]

_Secundo._ True learning does not look like learning, and we should be suspicious of anything that does. School does a wonderful job of putting up a show, but, as we have seen, this is just a mirage. When I told people I was quitting school to learn online, everyone thought I had taken leave of my senses. Why on earth would I drop out of the "finest tech university" in my country to learn online? Would there be exams? (There wouldn’t.) How then, could I hope to prove my prowess to the world without _makaratasi_? One gentleman even went as so far as to tell me that if he were hiring, he would turn me away the moment the words "learnt online" came out of my mouth. Such is the power of appearances (or a lack thereof). But lest we be fooled, let us remember, looks can be (and indeed they are) deceiving — _all that glitters is not gold_.

_Tertio._ Lower the cost of education. We have already seen how the exorbitant price exacted by higher education leads to rigidity, discouraging the making of mistakes and learning from them. Universities are pricing themselves out of the market. And when people realize that not only is education offered by e-learning platforms far less expensive, it is superior, it’s game over. _Quarto._ Stop commoditizing; let anyone study anything. Personally, dropping out afforded me the freedom to follow my curiosity. As a result, I have learnt about and made tremendous progress over a wide range of subjects. School gives people labels, e.g., Software Engineer, and confines them to that narrow mode of thinking, i.e., that is all they can do/are capable of. If someone tries to put you in a box, say unto them, "Not today, Procrustes!"

## The Emperor's New Clothes

> At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.
>
> — Matthew 11:25

Alas, our adventure is almost at an end. Thank you for sticking with me thus far. Now, I may have been aware of the system’s flaws (intuitively, if not consciously) when I made the decision to leave, but none of them truly answer the question _why I quit school_. Many are aware of the same shortcomings I am, but few leave. How so? What makes me different? Well, I like to think the answer lies within a childhood story many of us grew up with — [The Emperor’s New Clothes](https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/68/fairy-tales-and-other-traditional-stories/5637/the-emperors-new-clothes/).[^17]

It is not that we cannot see the Emperor parading "in all his glory," no. It’s just that we lack the courage to call him out, for fear we might be labelled foolish, or unfit for our jobs. We think to ourselves that if everyone else, even the wisest among us, can see the beautiful cloth adorning the Emperor, we must be the ones with the problem. So we compete to praise the garment, to describe it’s beautiful colours and patterns. It takes the voice of a brave child to lift us from our trance. And even then, just like the Emperor, we think to ourselves, _the show must go on_.

Even after I was confronted with the truth, I could have chosen to go on. To complete school, get my papers, be on the safe side. But something about that just didn’t agree with me. Life is short and fleeting, and we only get just the one. We should at least have the courage to live life the way we see it — a life we can truly be proud of, regardless of outcome. As Nassim Taleb said: "If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing." "A man is honorable in proportion to the personal risks he takes for his opinion — in other words, the amount of downside he is exposed to." "How much you truly ‘believe’ in something can be manifested only through what you are willing to risk for it." I would have never forgiven myself had I not found the courage to do stand up for what I believe in.

The other day, as I was engaged in an intense discussion with two of my friends about the company we intend to start, I paused to reflect about our backgrounds and how we all ended up there. One thing that immediately stood out to me is that we were all dropouts. Despite pursuing different degrees in different universities, and not being in contact with each other for huge amounts of time in between, we had all made independent decisions to quit school. Was it a coincidence that we now found ourselves together in this room, making plans for our startup? I think not!

As we shared stories of all the ostracism and humiliation we have suffered for choosing this path, it occurred to me that perhaps there are indeed people out there made of a different fabric. They are not afraid to rebel against society, and take personal risks for what they believe in. They have their skin in the game, and walk the walk. They have it in them to do great things and truly make a difference. I smiled to myself once I realized that, contrary to what most people would say, I was in the right company. We are the outcasts. The renegades. The resistance. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.

[^1]: For all the Calculus I "learnt" in high school and at the university, I (currently) couldn't recognize a relevant real world problem if it hit me with a brick made of differential equations. But hey, at least I can tell people I learnt Calculus at the university.
[^2]: An agency problem, or a principal-agent problem, occurs when the principal's (your) interests/incentives aren't aligned with the agent's (the one acting on your behalf). For example, citizens vote a politician into government hoping that he will act in their best interests. The politician, on the other hand, no longer needing the citizens, acts in his own best interest, using the platform as a means to get rich at their expense.
[^3]: The map is not the terrain. Or as Yogi Berra said, "In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, in practice there is." Or as any Kenyan local would tell you, _"Kwa ground vitu ni different."_
[^4]: Contrary to what the talkers and theorists believe and would have us believe — remember, they don't ride bikes, so they wouldn't know — one doesn't need to know the "relevant" abstract concepts to ride a bike. This observation raises significant questions: Just how many fields of expertise are in the grip of this fallacy; mistaking largely cosmetic elements that on the surface seem to count for those that actually do? And is there a point trying to grasp "relevant" abstract concepts when learning to ride a bike? Does it help one ride any better? Or should one avoid it altogether given it might lead them to be blind to that which matters?
[^5]: As to whether all the money minting is for personal gain, or to cover the (growing) costs of running these institutions, so blatantly mismanaged by talkers with no skin in the game, or both, alas, I cannot say.
[^6]: They hardly know their full range of options, what the professions themselves entail, nor the possibilities, save for a few scraps of information they've gathered from their equally ignorant friends and teachers.
[^7]: I suspect the reason people choose to go on is a mix of financial and social factors. Assume that based on the scant information I have on the profession (mostly that it pays very well and is in high demand, in addition to being very prestigious), I choose to pursue Medicine, self-sponsored. After a year in school I grow disillusioned and come to the realization that it isn't what I'd like to do; I would like to try something else. I now risk looking like a failure in front of friends and family. And after hundreds of thousands of shillings already spent at this point, I would find it very difficult to approach my parents (who had probably already boasted to many a parent that I was pursuing Medicine) and divulge my feelings.
[^8]: It was also the school my father had attended, so that only served to increase it's sentimental value to me.
[^9]: This was very much against the rules and a very risky gamble. The administration actively searched for phones that had been sneaked into school and those who got caught found themselves in a lot of trouble.
[^10]: The system was in a very sorry state, and it was getting worse every year. It wouldn't be until Education CS Fred Matiang'i was appointed that things would change; and even then, (some) people still found a way to cheat.
[^11]: Or perhaps unlucky, but that's a story for another day.
[^12]: Let's be sincere, who doesn't? And if we're being honest, it is particularly difficult to do the right thing when the environment actively penalizes it and encourages the opposite.
[^13]: The real master stroke would be to build one that is not only robust to human nature, but one that benefits from it; a system that gains from our worst inclinations and dispositions.
[^14]: Does God exist? Why is there something instead of nothing? What is life? What is consciousness? Do we have free will? What is the meaning of life? You know, those kind of questions.
[^15]: Could you imagine a world where Elon Musk would have had to have degrees in the Auto, Aerospace, Artificial Intelligence, Energy, etc. industries before he was allowed to start his companies?
[^16]: We also seem to be labouring under the delusion that Technology comes from Science, while it is in fact the other way around. We used aspirin for nigh on a century before we understood _how_ it worked, and medicinal plants containing its primary ingredient had been prescribed for millennia even before that. Religious handwashing rituals had existed for thousands of years even before Ignaz Semmelweis came along. Discoveries are made by practitioners, and only dressed up as Science later on. You cannot "teach" the next generation of Elons, because much of what they will go on to do hasn’t been done yet.
[^17]: I am continuously fascinated by just how deep the children’s stories we grew up with are. We were too young to see it then, but they are extremely relevant to the real world and contain tremendous amounts of wisdom.
